# Benchmarking various methods to deploy `wkt` and `to_wkt`

This repository was created to benchmark various ways in which `wkt` could be designed and
also because I wanted o try my hand at `Celero` ;).

This repo uses, yep you guessed it right, [Celero](https://github.com/DigitalInBlue/Celero) library 
for benchmarking. Quite useful and gives beautiful outputs.

That said I haven't uploaded results yet, so stay tuned.
